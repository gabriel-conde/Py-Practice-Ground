# Tim is working on a program that writes a poem to the console.
# However, Tim is having trouble getting the poem to print on only two lines.

part_one = "Roses are red, "  # Feeling poetic
part_two = "violets are blue."  # Classic rhyme
part_three = "Python is cool, "  # Pythonic praise
part_four = "and so are you!"  # Complimentary conclusion


line_one = part_one + part_two  # Combining lines one and two
line_two = part_three + part_four  # Combining lines three and four

print(line_one)  # Outputting the first line
print(line_two)  # Outputting the second line
