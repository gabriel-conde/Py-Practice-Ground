# Allan's favorite NBA Basketball team just played a 7 game series in the Playoffs. 
# He needs help writing a program that will calculate the average points scored by his team through the 7 games.

# Using the score variables, I assigned the average score of the 7 games to the average_score variable.

game_one_score = 97
game_two_score = 91
game_three_score = 106
game_four_score = 105
game_five_score = 96
game_six_score = 93
game_seven_score = 104

average_score = (
    game_one_score
    + game_two_score
    + game_three_score
    + game_four_score
    + game_five_score
    + game_six_score
    + game_seven_score
) / 7

print(round(average_score))
